Starting in the fall semester of 2017, I am at [Vanderbilt University][VANDERBILT].

I was previously an FWF Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Institute of Analysis and Number Theory][ANT] at Graz University of Technology. In the fall of 2014, I was a visitor at the [ESI][ESI] at the University of Vienna. In the spring of 2015, I was a visitor at [ICERM][ICERM] at Brown University.  In the summer of 2016, I was a summer researcher at [MSRI][MSRI]. - In the summer of 2017, I was at the [Aspen Center for Physics][ASPEN]. 

I studied at Haverford College and the University of Pittsburgh.

Over the years, my research has been partially supported by these institutions, the FWF, and the NSF in a variety of forms.

<!---Because of this, consider the site to be under construction.  Briefly, -->I am interested in problems of discrete geometry and geometric optimization
that are approachable by synthetic or analytic means and those where brute force computation is becoming tractable.

#### Right now I am thinking about:

- Critical density in packings of anisotropic objects
- The quality of point sets on the sphere
- Configuration spaces of hard disks
- Hyperuniform structures in the compact setting
- Topologically sweeping rope

I am also interested in building physical models of some of these things.


<!---For more detail, you will need to go somewhere else, as this site (as of 2014) is here to test a template.  Otherwise, you would be able to check below for a 
for a short overview, or even find a link to a more recent copy my [CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/KusnerCV.pdf). For more info, search elsewhere. Google is pretty good at finding me these days.-->

For search purposes it may be helpful to consider my name as Woden Kusner or Woeden Kusner.
