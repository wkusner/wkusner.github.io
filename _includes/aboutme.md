I am currently on the job market.

I was at the [University of Georgia][UGA] through the spring of 2022.
Previously I was at [Vanderbilt University][VANDERBILT] from 2017, and an FWF Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Institute of Analysis and Number Theory][ANT] at Graz University of Technology from 2014. I was also a visitor at the [ESI][ESI] at the University of Vienna and  [ICERM][ICERM] at Brown University, and a summer researcher at [MSRI][MSRI] and the [Aspen Center for Physics][ASPEN]. Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, I was a remote visitor at the [Fields Institute][FIELDS] in 2021 and the ESI in 2022.

I studied at [Haverford College][HAVERFORD] and the [University of Pittsburgh][PITT].

Over the years, my research has been partially supported by some these institutions, the FWF, and the NSF in a variety of forms.

Recently, I have been studying and teaching a great deal of probability and statistics.
If you want some reasons why a mathematician should do that, I refer you to Mumford's "The Dawning of the Age of Stochasticity".

<!---Because of this, consider the site to be under construction.  Briefly, -->I am interested in problems of discrete geometry and geometric optimization
that are approachable by synthetic or analytic means and those where brute force computation is becoming tractable.

#### Right now I am thinking about:

- Critical density in packings of anisotropic objects
- The quality of point sets on the sphere
- Configuration spaces of hard disks
- Hyperuniform structures in the compact setting
- Topologically sweeping rope

I am also interested in building physical models of some of these things.

<!---For more detail, you will need to go somewhere else, as this site (as of 2014) is here to test a template.  Otherwise, you would be able to check below for a 
for a short overview, or even find a link to a more recent copy my [CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/KusnerCV.pdf). For more info, search elsewhere. Google is pretty good at finding me these days.-->

#### Snow from yesterday: 
- Packing problems are in the news! [Viazovska is awarded the Fields Medal for her solution to the 8 dimensional sphere packing problem.][viazovska] See also her work on t-designs....

For search purposes it may be helpful to consider my name as Woden Kusner or Woeden Kusner.
