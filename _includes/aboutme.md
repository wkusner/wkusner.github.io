I am an FWF Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Institute for Analysis and Computational Number Theory][ACNT] at Technische Universit√§t Graz.
[I am also currently checking a series of instructions for building a website hosted on GitHub. ][louis]



Because of this, consider the site to be under construction.  Briefly, I am interested problems of Discrete Geometry 
that are approachable by synthetic and analytic means and those where brute force computation is becoming tractable.
I am also interested in more esoteric projects like editing and auditing papers and instructions for things like how 
to build and host a site on GitHub.

Right now I am thinking about:

- Critical density in packings of anisotropic objects
- The quality of point sets on the sphere

For more detail, you will need to go somewhere else, as this site (as of 2014) is here to test a template.  Otherwise, you would be able to check below for a 
for a short overview, or even find a link to a more recent copy my [CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/KusnerCV.pdf). For more info, search elsewhere. Google is pretty good at finding me these days.
