I am an [Aalto Science Fellow][ascifellow] and a member of the Department of [Information
and Computer Science][ics] at [Aalto University][aalto]. I'm also the PI of the thematic
program [Challenges in Large Geometric Structures and Big Data][largestructures] at
[AScI][asci]. I organize an associated [seminar][seminar].

In Fall 2014, I am teaching a [computational geometry class][cg14].

I like to work on problems that feature an interaction between geometry, combinatorics,
and algorithmic considerations. I also like theoretical problems that arise out of
concrete, applied scenarios.

My main projects right now center around:

- The rigidity and flexibility of frameworks
- Algebraic and combinatorial approaches to machine learning and data analysis
