I have been thinking about content creation, and how I still want to write every day. 
There is a certain trade off that I can't quite get around.  If I want to write every
day with a certain minimum standard of quality, I need to dedicate more time to doing
interesting things and also more time to writing. 

If I stick to certain themes, perhaps I can meet my goal of writing every day and creating
content for a post every week.  

Now that I think about it, the post format supports this as well, since I can date content for future
publication.

Goal: write everyday with a content update on the weekend.
