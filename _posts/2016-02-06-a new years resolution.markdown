My first project here is to maintain a short journal.

At the beginning of the year (2016), I made a common New Year's resolution; that I would
 write more.  This is a resolution that I make every year, and in the past I have kept a 
 journal or started posting blog entries much like this one. This generally results in a few 
 written pages at the beginning of an otherwise empty notebook or a few blog posts at the 
 beginning the year.    

Since this site is based on a "blog aware" platform and the directory structure really 
encourages posts rather than pages, I thought it might be fun to try to work in that framework.

  The goal is to migrate and organize old content, and generate new content to this site, where it is hopefully easier to combine in a semi-coherent fashion. 

So even though it is already Faschingssamstag: „Einen guten Rutsch ins neue Jahr!“
