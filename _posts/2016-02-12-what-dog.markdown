Aside from photos of actual dogs, I suspect that the first thing anyone does at [What Dog?][wd]
is enter a picture of a person.  I don't get particularly consistent results, so I'll just limit 
this entry to what the dog-identifying AI thinks of the picture on my website and the traits 
it associates with me.
