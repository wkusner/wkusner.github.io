I have been working on a Moeck Tuju soprano recorder that I found at a thrift store for â‚¬4? and since it was art day, half of that. It has some damage, but I have been able to [remove the block][pb], oil it and fill a crack with cyanoacrylate (superglue!) and it is looking alright.  It also (maybe) sounds ok, despite my messing around with it.
