I'll probably re-categorize things or use "journal" as another catch-all.

A few days ago I received confirmation that I will be getting a TU Graz bike! Sometime!  
I'm very excited because I missed the last round of orders and it seems to be a really 
good deal.  I'm only supposed to pay <s>€189</s> €169! for a seemingly pretty nice tourer.
Since I don't have a car in Graz, I'll have a bit more flexibility for my transit this 
spring.
