A major neglected project of mine has been to catalog my library. In Pittsburgh I probably 
had a couple hundred books.  Combined with books from the rest of my life, I might have to
catalog several thousand books without even thinking about where to put them.  


 In Austria, I have a fairly small collection, certainly less than 100.  It seems like a 
 good place to start, except that I may end up leaving most of them here at some point.  
 Shipping seems to be a bit of a pain.  
 
 The first thing is to combine a reasonable catalog program --I used to use [Book Hunter][bh]--
 and a barcode scanner.  I have tried using my laptop camera to scan barcodes, but it never 
 worked as well as I hoped.  The lighting and resolution was not up to snuff.  
 
 Then, I need categories.  As with this series of posts, categorizing books is a painful
 task.  I read some where that a good classification of documents should partition what 
 you have to sort into consistant sizes.  Perhaps one way to do this is to add as much metadata
 as possible and then processes it into an equal size partition?  That would probably be
 too much work, but it might be a fun data analysis project to attach to the (already immense)
 catalog project.

 Maybe step zero is to clean up my desk and the documents on my computer.  Again.
