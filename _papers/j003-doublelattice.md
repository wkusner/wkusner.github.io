### Abstract:

This paper introduces a new technique for proving the local optimality of packing

configurations of Euclidean space. Applying this technique to a general convex polygon,

we prove that under mild assumptions satisfied generically, the construction of the

optimal double lattice packing by Kuperberg and Kuperberg is also locally optimal in

the full space of packings.
