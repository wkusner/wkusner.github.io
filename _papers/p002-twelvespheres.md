### Abstract:

Currently non-circulating, under review. 

The problem of  $12$ spheres  is to understand the structure of the  configuration space of $12$ 
nonoverlapping equal spheres  touching a central unit sphere, broadened to allow the touching spheres 
to have radius $r$, with $0< r < r_{max}(12)$, as a function of $r$.  It considers to what extent,
and in what fashion, touching spheres can be moved around on the unit sphere, subject to the constraint 
of always touching the central sphere. Such  constrained motion problems are of interest in physics and 
materials science, and the  problem involves topology and geometry.

This paper reviews the history of work on this problem, and formulates some conjectures. It also addresses 
results on configuration spaces of $N$ spheres of radius $r$ touching a central unit sphere, for $3 \le N\le 14$.
The problem of determining the maximal radius  $r_{max}(N)$ is equivalent to  the Tammes problem, to which  
L\'{a}szl\'{o} Fejes-T\'{o}th made significant contributions.
