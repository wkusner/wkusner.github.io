  We show that every packing of regular pentagons in the Euclidean plane has
density less than 0.9611. Our proof is computer-assisted. We also give a
detailed strategy for proving the Kuperberg-Kuperberg conjecture, which
asserts
that the optimal packing of regular pentagons in the plane is a double
lattice,
formed by aligned vertical columns of upward pointing pentagons alternating
with aligned vertical columns of downward pointing pentagons. The
strategy is
based on estimates of the areas of Delaunay triangles. Our strategy
reduces the
Kuperberg conjecture to area minimization problems that involve at most four
acute Delaunay triangles.
