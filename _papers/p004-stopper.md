### Abstract:

We provide an example of a universal family of physical rope stop- per links which cannot pass through an aperture without being cut. These methods extend to give a simple demonstration that the physical nature of rope, namely thickness, can obstruct otherwise topologically permissible paths in the configuration space of such links.
