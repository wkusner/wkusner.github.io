### Abstract:

The concept of hyperuniformity has been introduced by Torquato and Stillinger in 2003 as a notion to detect structural behaviour intermediate between amorphous disorder and crystalline order. The present paper studies a generalisation of this concept to the unit sphere. It is shown that several well studied determinantal point processes are hyperuniform, one recently introduced process, the projective ensemble, is shown not to be hyperuniform.
