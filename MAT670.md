## Packings, Lattices and Configurations

### Summer Term 2016

This course will introduce a variety of different tools and models to explore some of the theory 
of geometric configuration spaces that underlie physical systems.

We will address a number of different areas from the perspective of discrete geometry. By
the end of the course, you should have some familiarity with the geometry and topology of configuration spaces,
Morse theory, the geometry of lattices, maximal density arrangements, random packings and statistical mechanics.

Some basic knowledge of topology, analysis, algebra and geometry will be assumed, but we will begin at an introductory level.  

Language of instruction is English


Vorbesperchung: TBA, see Course Listing
