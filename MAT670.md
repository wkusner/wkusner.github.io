## Packings, Lattices and Configurations

### Summer Term 2016

This course will introduce a variety of different tools and models to explore some of the theory 
of geometric configuration spaces that underlie physical systems.

We will address a number of different areas from the perspective of discrete geometry. By
the end of the course, you should have some familiarity with the geometry and topology of configuration spaces,
Morse theory, the geometry of lattices, maximal density arrangements, random packings and statistical mechanics.

Some basic knowledge of topology, analysis, algebra and geometry will be assumed, but we will begin at an introductory level.  

Language of instruction is English


Vorbesperchung: TBA, see Course Listing

Meeting Time: Mondays, 15:00-17:00, see Course Listing for location.

### Quiz Monday, May 23 2016

For the second half of the lecture period, there will be a quiz on the material covered so far. It will consist of the following types of problems:

 - Short definitions
 - Short questions
 - Sketches of longer proofs
